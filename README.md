# 🛡️ Threat Detection System

This project is a full-stack application for threat detection, leveraging AI/ML models in Python. It has a React.js front end for user interaction and a Node.js backend to manage API requests and communication.

# 🚀 Getting Started 

## 🌐Frontend (React)
***
Navigate to the client directory
```
$ cd client 
$ npm run dev
``` 


## 🌐Backend (Node.js)
***
Navigate to the server directory
```
$ cd server 
$ nodemon server.js
``` 


## 🌐AI Models (Python - Flask)
***
Navigate to the ai_models directory
```
$ cd ai_models 
$ python app.py
```



This will start your AI models for threat detection, probably running a server or an API for handling model predictions.

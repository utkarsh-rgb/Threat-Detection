# 🛡️ Threat Detection System

This project is a full-stack application for threat detection, leveraging AI/ML models in Python, a React.js frontend for user interaction, and a Node.js backend to manage API requests and communication.

# 🚀 Getting Started

###  1. 🌐 Frontend (React)
Navigate to the client folder and start the React app:

cd client
npm install    # Run this only once to install dependencies
npm run dev
This will run the frontend on http://localhost:5173 

###  2. 🌐 Backend (Node.js)
Navigate to the server folder and run the Node.js server using nodemon:

cd server
npm install    # Run this only once to install dependencies
nodemon server.js
###  3. 🔍 AI Models (Python - Threat Detection)

**Navigate to the AI models directory and run the Python backend:**

cd ai_models
python app.py
